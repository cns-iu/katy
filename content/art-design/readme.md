A believer that data is not only of practical value but also beautiful, BÃ¶rner collaborates with artists and designers from around the globe, including talents such as: Ingo Gunther, Ward Shelley, and Philip Beesley. These partnerships produced interactive macroscopes, data sculptures, science globes, educational puzzles, an award-winning film, a comic book, and much more. Many of these works travel the world as part of the [*Places & Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit*](https://scimaps.org "Places & Spaces exhibit site").
