Börner is a passionate teacher who is deeply interested in making high-quality education accessible to all. In 2014, she was the first Indiana University faculty member to teach a massively open online course (MOOC), the Information Visualization MOOC. Students from more than 100 countries took this course and learned together. In 2019, CNS launched the [*Visual Analytics Certificate*](https://visanalytics.cns.iu.edu "Visual Analytics Certificate site") course to professional audiences. In 2020, CNS in partnership with the National Institutes of Health funded HuBMAP team, created the freely available [*Visible Human MOOC*](https://expand.iu.edu/browse/sice/cns/courses/hubmap-visible-human-mooc "Visible Human MOOC site") to engage novices and experts in creating a reference map of the healthy human body—mapping all 37 trillion cells.

Since 1998, she has taught a variety of courses at Indiana University covering topics such as:

  * Information Visualization
  * Structural Data Mining and Modeling
  * User Interface Design for Information Systems
  * Introduction to Human Computer Interaction
