Katy Börner’s work expands the possibilities of data analysis and visualization. A scholar, designer, author, and educator, she inspires a diverse global audience to transform data into visualizations that are insightful and actionable to improve the human condition. Her mission to promote data literacy across all age groups has led her to explore many types of media, to give talks at all sizes of venues, and to have her exhibits hosted everywhere from the local library to world-renowned museums, science academies, and global institutions.
 
At Indiana University, Börner is the Victor Yngve Distinguished Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering and the founding director of the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS).
